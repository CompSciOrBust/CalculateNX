# CalculateNX
A simple calculator for the Nintendo Switch.

I made this to learn how touchscreens work with SDL. Only handheld mode it supported.

## Building
To build use the latest version of [LibNX](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) and DevkitPro.

## Credits
LibNX and DevkitPro for making the toolchain.
